Sophisticated DLNA/UPnP Media Server systems are often CPU intensive and rarely cross platform or inter-operable. With a simple, HTML5 based system, any HTML5 capable browser can stream videos, audio and images easily. This system requires only a PHP-enabled web server on the host, and allows Media Server like access to even the most basic netbooks. As this is designed for use on a home server, issues such as security are ignored.

This is a great alternative to setting up annoyingly painful networking solutions like Samba, and has been verified to work with Android, the Lynx browser under a pure-CLI Linux, Windows, Mac OSX and a PS3. It should be able to easily serve files to any platform with a web browser.
